# GUI-Application-Electronic-Lock
Here we are creating a Java Swing GUI application for an electronic lock.
The display shall show the state of either "CLOSE" or "OPEN".
In the "CLOSE" state, the user types his PIN followed by the "Enter" key to unlock the system. 
The display shall show an asterisk (*) for each number entered.
The display shall show "WRONG PIN" if the PIN is incorrect.
The "Clear" button clears the number entered (if any), locks the system and sets the display to "CLOSE".
